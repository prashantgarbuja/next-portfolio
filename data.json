  "about": {
    "about": "Hi there! Iâ€™m a software developer based in Sydney, Australia, with a lifelong passion for technology. It all started with my love for computer games as a kid, which sparked my curiosity about how things work. I spent countless hours tweaking PC settings and finding clever ways to run new games, and thatâ€™s where my journey into tech truly began.
Outside of work, I enjoy reading, traveling (as long as it fits my budget!), and stepping out of my comfort zoneâ€”something Iâ€™ve embraced more as an adult compared to my introverted childhood.
In the world of tech, coding feels like my creative outlet. I started with C and C++, then expanded my toolkit to include C#, Java, and Python. Java, with all its verbosity, still holds a special place as it keeps my foundational skills sharp.
I earned my Bachelor's in Computer Science Engineering in Bangalore, fulfilling my dream of combining exploration and technology. After moving to Sydney, I completed a Masterâ€™s in Information Technology and dove deeper into the tech community by attending seminars and Java meetups. Connecting with like-minded people has been such a rewarding experience!
I value kindness and respect in all interactions and would love to chat if youâ€™d like to know more about me. ðŸ˜Š",
